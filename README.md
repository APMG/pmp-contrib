# PMP community contributions

This project is for community contributions to the PMP (http://pmp.io/ https://github.com/publicmediaplatform).

Contributions can incubate here until the PMP includes them in the core.

## Requirements

Many of the features of this project require the Perl PMP SDK Net::PMP (https://github.com/APMG/pmp-sdk-perl).

## About

PMP document fixtures are stored in the fixtures/ directory. You can install them
to a PMP environment with:

    % make install-fixtures
